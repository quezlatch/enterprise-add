# enterprise add

Adding numbers together might seem simple, but how do you make it enterprise?


## Requirements

* rust (obvs)
* terraform
* cargo make
* cargo generate

## Random thoughts

* should `logic` expose serde, etc and the apps use them through that?
* should the whole thing be built through docker?
